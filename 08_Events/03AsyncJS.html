        clearTimeout(firstTimeout)
        // We can remove a timeout by giving it's refrence to clearTimeout but we generally don't want to remove the Timeout like this beacuse it is similar to not attaching the timeout as it clear it without any interaction. We generally want to clear the timeout if anything wrong happened in code or using user interaction such as clicking a button.
