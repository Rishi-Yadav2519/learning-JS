            DOM stands for document object model where we can manipulate all our webpage as an object through JavaScript directly. It contains understanding the document for combining functions with the document itself, creating new objects in document with JavaScript, styling them with JavaScript etc. etc.

        <p>
            Events are the things which occur on our page such as someone clicked, hovered, give input through keyboard etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Doing console.log(window) on any webpage we get to see our whole web page as a object. Window is the parent of all nodes in our page. If we do console.log(window.document) then we got our complete webpage structured as a document. It's the point we are going to study.

        <p>
            It is so common for JavaScript to target an element through window.document so that we don't have to mention the window itself as it is understood by JavaScript by default, we just have to mention document. and whatever we want to target or do. Some properties are hidden by default in our browser or object if we want to see that properties as well we can check with console.dir(document).
